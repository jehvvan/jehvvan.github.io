The "trolley problem" is an ethical dilemma, that is a significant concern in the development of autonomous vehicles. It involves decisions on how self-driving cars should act when human harm is inevitable. This is usually a topic of debate but I think the solution is rather simple.

The assumption here is that if an autonomous car has only two options - one leading to its intended path with people and the other to an alternative path - it will always choose its intended path, even if it means causing harm.

However, considering factors like the number of people on the street or the importance of a person on the intended path shouldn't be based on societal or economic benefits. The established justice system prioritizes the principle that no one is above the law, so a person's wealth or status should not influence the decision.

The focus here is on simplifying accountability in accidents involving autonomous cars and pedestrians. In such cases, it's easier to determine fault when it's between the autonomous car and the person crossing the road. This approach avoids complicated legal issues that may arise if the autonomous car collides with an unrelated group of pedestrians not involved in the initial incident.

For example, if a pedestrian is jaywalking on the intended path, and the autonomous car chooses to hit another pedestrian on a different road, the latter pedestrian may be fatally injured, while the jaywalker remains unharmed. The solution emphasizes the importance of clear accountability, reducing legal complexities and ensuring that the actions of the autonomous car are legally defensible.
