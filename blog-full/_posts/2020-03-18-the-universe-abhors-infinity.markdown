If you were someone who lived in a time when no one knew the Earth was spherical, then you might think that the land on Earth is infinite. Without any landmarks or knowledge of where you are, you would believe the land on Earth to be limitless because you could walk endlessly on Earth without falling off the edges. However, the universe isn't also finite in the way people in the past thought that if you walked far enough to the edge of the world, you would fall off the Earth.

When people see our Earth as part of an expansive universe, they automatically assume that the universe is infinite. This is probably because we cannot comprehend that we are such a small speck in a universe so vast yet seemingly not infinite. Then we discovered the Big Bang, where the universe had a start. But the Big Bang isn't a point from which the universe expanded. Right now, the universe is expanding from every direction, surprisingly faster and faster. However, if the universe had a beginning, that would mean it is not infinite. To be infinite, something would have to come into existence all together and span everywhere forever. We don't have anything in our universe that has that level of infinity. If the universe had a start, it implies that it had to grow with time, and with that inference, it isn't infinite. Similar to the Earth, we couldn't travel to the edge of the universe and fall off the edge or float into nothingness. The universe, like the Earth, probably wraps into itself one way or another.

Taking it a step further, we can infer that time isn't infinite as well, since time is nothing more than a dimension in our space-time continuum. If time isn't infinite, that means time probably loops back onto itself like Earth and our universe. Perhaps, if we lived long enough, we might come back to a point in time where we see ourselves being born.
