			<h2>Everything is Nature-Built</h2>
<time>May 21, 2020</time>

<p>When one stumbles upon a car nestled within the depths of a forest, it triggers a peculiar reaction—a stark contrast between the man-made and the natural world. It’s a reaction ingrained in our collective consciousness, one that has us perceiving ourselves as distinct from other creatures due to our unique capacity to conceive and construct intricate objects like cars and computers. We’ve long maintained a rigid demarcation, a clear divide between our creations and the environment, a divide as unmistakable as the separation of land and sea. Yet, as we scrutinize this division, we find it less absolute than it initially seems.</p>

<p>Consider the scene: a car, a tangible testament to human ingenuity, resting under the forest canopy, and a termite mound nearby. The car—a marvel of engineering, the termite mound—an architectural masterpiece crafted by countless termites. At first glance, they appear as polar opposites—one, a result of human innovation, and the other, a manifestation of nature’s intricate processes. Nevertheless, the line that separates them begins to blur upon closer examination, forcing us to reconsider our conventional notions of what is natural and what is man-made.</p>

<p>Should we entertain the idea of the termite mound as a natural creation, sculpted meticulously by termites over time, we must inevitably question why we categorize the car, painstakingly constructed by humans, as inherently different. Could it be that our ability to manipulate and shape the environment through our inventions is merely another facet of nature’s grand design? What if the division between the natural and the man-made is not as rigid as we’ve been conditioned to believe?</p>

<p>Termites themselves are astonishing creatures. They embark on architectural endeavors that rival our own, constructing intricate mounds to house their colonies. These structures serve a multitude of vital functions, from temperature regulation to defense against predators. Their construction is an innate part of their existence, driven by primal instincts and the needs of their species.</p>

<p>Now, consider humans. We, too, are driven by instincts and needs. We require shelter, transportation, and tools for survival and progress. In response to these needs, we’ve erected dwellings, engineered transportation systems, and designed tools and machines—the very cars that occasionally find themselves deep within the woods. Just as termites build mounds as a natural expression of their species, humans create cars and other technological marvels as natural expressions of our own.</p>

<p>The crux of understanding the connection between the car in the forest and the termite mound lies in our perspective. When we observe the termite mound, we view it as an outcome of nature’s processes, shaped by eons of evolution and the survival instincts of termites. We recognize that termites are an integral part of the grand tapestry of the natural world.</p>

<p>Now, apply that perspective to the car. If we consider that humans, like termites, are products of nature, then the creations of humans, including cars, can be seen as natural extensions of our species. In this light, our inventions become just another manifestation of the vast diversity that nature itself encompasses.</p>

<p>Revising our understanding of the natural world to encompass the products of human ingenuity has far-reaching implications for our relationship with the environment. It encourages us to see ourselves not as separate from nature but as active participants in a complex web of life. We are a species with the remarkable capacity to shape and adapt to our surroundings, much like any other species.</p>

<p>This perspective invites us to adopt a more responsible and harmonious approach to our environment. Recognizing that our creations are, ultimately, products of nature may lead us to consider their impact on the natural world more deeply and push us toward sustainable solutions. It could serve as the catalyst for a transition to more eco-friendly technologies and practices, aligning human innovation more closely with the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the car in the forest serves as a compelling reminder that our traditional distinctions between what is natural and what is man-made are not as unequivocal as they once appeared. When we view it through the lens of nature’s diversity, it becomes evident that it, too, is a product of the same forces that shaped the termites and their mounds. This perspective bridges the gap between human creations and nature, inviting us to reevaluate our role in the natural world. We are not separate from nature but intricately woven into its tapestry, entrusted with the responsibility of nurturing and preserving its delicate balance. Embracing this perspective may very well be the key to a more sustainable and harmonious future, both for humanity and for the planet we call home.</p>
