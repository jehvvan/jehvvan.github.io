			<h2>Why Kids Need to Showcase Their Creations: Sharing the Joy of Coding</h2>
<time>Feb 11, 2023</time>

<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of learning to code is the ability to share your creations with friends and family. For kids, being able to showcase their cool designs and share their code is a natural progression in their coding journey. It’s a chance to proudly display their digital handiwork and spark excitement in those around them. This is where Gravity Graphics steps in, providing a platform that not only fosters creativity but also facilitates the sharing of their coding accomplishments.</p>

<p>At Gravity Graphics, we understand the importance of enabling kids to present their work to a wider audience. Our platform comes equipped with its own open-source library that kids can access from the internet. This means that they can run their code in any web browser or JavaScript code editor, as well as showcase their projects on websites like codepen.io. With this feature, kids have the freedom to display their code and designs anywhere and on any platform, opening up a world of possibilities for sharing and collaboration.</p>

<p>But our commitment to empowering young coders goes beyond just the presentation of their work. We firmly believe in teaching kids to code using direct text input from the keyboard, rather than relying on drag-and-drop code snippets, as is common on many coding learning platforms. While drag-and-drop interfaces can be helpful initially, they can also create a dependency that limits a child’s ability to adapt to different programming platforms or online editors.</p>

<p>By embracing direct text input, kids become proficient in the universal language of coding. This method ensures that they can seamlessly transition to any platform or environment, where all coding is performed using this input method. It empowers them with a skill set that is not only versatile but also valuable as they progress in their coding journey.</p>

<p>The ability to showcase their work to friends and family is a vital part of a child’s coding experience. It fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment and encourages them to continue exploring the world of coding. Gravity Graphics provides the tools and support necessary for kids to not only create amazing projects but also share them with the world. With our open-source library and focus on direct text input, we empower young coders to code confidently and showcase their talents wherever their coding adventures take them.</p>
